The Memory Game is a simple yet a very fun game for all ages. The objective of the game is to turn pairs over and manage to match all 16 cards. At the beginning of the game, all cards are shuffled and turned down. Clicking one of the card it will turn around, then when a second card is clicked the game will check if the clicked cards are matching. If the cards match they will remain open, if not the cards will turn back. The fun part of this game is to remember the cards place so in as short time, with less number of moves and with as many stars as possible you manage to win the game.
The user will lose a star when it reaches the 9 respective 18 and 25 moves. Therefore, after 25 moves the user will have 0 stars. The number of moves will start counting when the game will check if two cards match or not match.
The game is over when all 16 cards are paired! Than a message will pop up with a congratulations message according to the users results. The message will contain as well the number of moves, stars and in how much time the user managed to finish the game.
The user also can choose to play again the game by clicking the “Play again” button in the congratulation message at the end of the game or restart the game by clicking the restart button (top right corner). By restarting the game the time, number of moves and stars will be reset.
